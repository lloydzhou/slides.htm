This is a tool to convert POD-like text into a shiney HTML
based slides. We borrowed most of the code and style from
the excellent XUL slidemaker tool named Sporx.

To produce your own slides, just edit sample-slides.sld
file and run "make" again. If you prefer another file name,
just rename the sample-slides.sld file and also edit the
Makefile's first line to my-new-name.html where "my-new-name"
is your slides source file's new basename.

Final sample-slides.html can be browsed here
